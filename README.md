## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This web-based system keeps track of student performance by allowing users to add, view, sort, and delete student records based on their General Weighted Average (GWA). It functions as a leaderboard where students with the best GWAs can be ranked.

### Key Components
<!-- TODO: List of Key Components -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
- Add Student Records 
Professors can input student details such as Student No., Name, Section, GWA.

- Display Leaderboard Table 
The table dynamically updates whenever a student is added or removed.

- Professors can click on table headers to sort records by:
  1. Student Number (Numerical & Alphabetical Order)
  2. Name (Alphabetically)
  3. GWA (Ascending or Descending)
  > Professors can also remove student entries.

- The table updates instantly after deletion.
- User-Friendly Design
